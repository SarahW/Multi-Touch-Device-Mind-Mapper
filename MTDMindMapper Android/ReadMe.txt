	  **********************************
	  
Multi/Touch/Device MindMapper enables the creation, manipulation and storage of ideas and
the relations between those ideas in a multi touch, multi device brainstorming or mind mapping 
setting. The application consists of two parts; a multi touch application based
on the Mt4j framework that enables the user to create ideas and connect those 
ideas via directed edges. These ideas and connections can be manipulated by numerous touch gestures
(X-Gesture for deletion, dragging gesture for moving, flicking gesture for moving at greater
speed etc.) and collections of ideas and mind maps can be saved and loaded at any time.
The second part of the application is an Android application (this application) that can connect to the 
multi touch application via bluetooth to send single ideas from an Android phone to the multi touch 
device in a multi device setting.
